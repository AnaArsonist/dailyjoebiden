module.exports = JSON.parse('["The American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.","Here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.","All our differences hardly measure up to the values we all hold in common.","Folks, winning means uniting America, not sowing seeds of division and anger and hate. We got to beat Donald Trump, and we will, but we can\'t become like him.","History, faith, and reason show the way--the way of unity. We can see each other, not as adversaries, but as neighbors. We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.","The coronavirus doesn\'t care if you\'re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender, or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power, as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We\'re all in this together. This is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us. To look out for our neighbor, to understand the fear and stress that so many are feeling. To care for the elderly, the elderly couple down the street. To thank the healthcare worker, the doctors, the nurses, the pharmacists, the grocery store cashier, and the people restocking the shelves. To believe in one another. Because I assure you when we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we lift this nation up and we\'ll get through this together. That\'s how we\'ve always done it.","Folks, we just have to remember who we are. My Lord, this is the United States of America, and it\'s time for America to get back up, and once again, fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, and that by the creator with certain inalienable rights. We say it so often in school, we don\'t realize how profound it is. Weve never lived up to those words, but up to this President [Trump], we\'ve never walked away from it.","We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference.","My mother\'s creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. You are everyone\'s equal, and everyone is equal to you.","We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we\'ve acted together.","We all know--or at least we are told continually--that we are a divided people. And we know there\'s a degree of truth in it. We have too often allowed our differences to prevail among us. We have too often allowed ambitious men to play off those differences for political gain. We have too often retreated behind our differences when no one really tried to lead us beyond them. But all our differences hardly measure up to the values we all hold in common.","When we\'ve stood as one, this nation has never ever been defeated, when we\'ve been together, and we\'re not going to be defeated now. The pandemic of 1918, the Great Depression, two world wars, we overcame them all. And out of each crisis, we emerged stronger and we will again.","Trump has fanned the flames of hate and sought to divide us. He\'s insulted, demonized, and actually just the way he talks about people. He has not a single ounce of empathy. He doesn\'t have any compassion, no regard for the values that made this country who we are, not the way you were raised by your moms and dads. He looks at honesty and decency and respect and he views it as a sign of weakness. He doesn\'t believe that we\'re the beacon to the world. He doesn\'t believe we\'re all part of something bigger than ourselves. That\'s why I\'ve said from the moment I announced for this candidacy, we are literally in a battle for the soul of America.","Rudy Giuliani -- there\'s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb, and 9/11.","If you do politics the right way, I believe, you can actually make people\'s lives better. And integrity is the minimum ante to get into the game.","We need an economy that rewards work, not just wealth.","I believe all Americans are born with certain inalienable rights. As a child of God, I believe my rights are not derived from the constitution. My rights are not derived from any government. My rights are not denied by any majority. My rights are because I exist. They were given to me and each of my fellow citizens by our creator, and they represent the essence of human dignity.","For the world to follow, we must do more than rattle our sabers and demand allegienace to our vision simply because we believe we are right. We must provide a reason for others to aspire to that vision. And that reason must come with more than the repetition of a bumper-sticker phrase about freedom and democracy. It must come with more than the restatement of failed policy. It must come with the wisdom to admit when we are wrong and resolve to change course and get it right.","In Washington, D. C., a gaffe is when you tell the truth.","The fabric of our complex society is woven too tightly to permit any part of it to be damaged without damaging the whole.","Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response. And I, along with every American, hope he steps up and starts to get this right.","Bernie as a nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign for him. I believe the people who support me will do the same thing. Because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump. It\'s critical. I would hope that Bernie would do the same thing if I am the nominee, and encourage all of his followers to in fact, support me as well. Because it\'s much bigger than either of us. Character of the nation is on the ballot. It goes well beyond whether or not Senator Sanders and I both agree ... healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. We both agree we have to deal with student debt. We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education. We both agree that we have a new Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity. We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don\'t disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything.","The coronavirus is not Donald Trump\'s fault, but he does bear responsibility for our response and taking his duty seriously. It\'s about doing the job as a president. His failures and his delays continue. We continue to see it. And it\'s caused a real pain for so many Americans.","Later today, you\'ll hear from the president in his daily briefing. These briefings are an important opportunity to inform and reassure the American public. They\'re not a place for political attacks, or to lash out at the press. They\'re about the American people. So I hope today and in the days ahead, the president will give us the unvarnished truth. That\'s who the American people need and what they deserve. I hope we let some medical experts and FEMA leaders and others carrying out the work to take center stage, to hear from them directly. And I hope we hear less talk and see more evidence of fast action.","Americans should be leading the world, marshaling a coordinated global response, both on the public health and on economic fronts. Giving our skilled union members what they need to manufacture the equipment, supplies and medicines we need now so we can take care of our people here at home and support the needs of vulnerable populations around the world. Unfortunately, President Trump is still not moving very quickly. Not quickly enough I should say that from my perspective. He\'s not prioritizing workers. He\'s not getting out of the way and let the scientists make the judgments. He\'s not using all the authority he has under the federal law to make sure healthcare workers are getting equipped and the supplies they need. He\'s not directing OSHA to enforce the law to protect workers from infectious disease. He\'s not helping governors who are forced to bid against one another and the federal government to get what they need.","We kept our promise to remove all American troops from Iraq -- Iraqi cities. We kept our promise to end our combat mission last August and to reduce our forces in Iraq to 50,000. At the end of this month, we will keep our promise to remove our remaining troops from Iraq, which, when we came to office, numbered 140,000 American forces. Where I come from, where the President comes from, a promise made is a promise kept. And we are keeping our promise.","One role of government is to go where venture capital won\'t. In the Civil War, you had a president pay the railroads $16,000 for every mile of track they laid. You had Eisenhower invest $25 million in a defense agency called ARPA that came up with a thing that became the internet. ","The greatest sin a man or woman can commit is the abuse of power.","There is truth and there are lies, lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies.","I believe the measure of a man isn\'t just the road he\'s traveled; it\'s the choices he\'s made along the way.","Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a nation. We\'ve got to restore this country\'s soul, that\'s essential. As long as this president is there, we\'re not going to be able to that.","There are periods in our country\'s history when Americans re-examine the essence of our social contract. They have occurred half a dozen times. These periods invariably include debate over the meaning of our \\"civil bible\\" -- the Constitution -- because we have relied so much on that document to articulate how we see ourselves as a people and how we see ourselves as a nation.","The vice-presidency is not a job designed to enhance your standing.","No matter how well intended our country is, we cannot expect other nations to trust us as much as we trust ourselves. ","To all those who supported our campaign, I\'m humbled by the faith you\'ve placed in us. To all of those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That\'s democracy. That\'s America.","To overcome these challenges, to restore the soul and secure the future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity.","Trump likes to say he\'s a wartime president. Well, he needs to step up and act like it.","Iran is not a monolith. Our greatest allies against the theocracy are the Iranian people. They admire America. But we never get our side of the argument into Iran to the people who could insist, over time, that the government change course. They never hear our voice. America, whose greatest strengths are her ideas and ideals, has become afraid to talk. It\'s time to find our voice again.","Our intelligence officials were warning of coronavirus threat in January. Just based on public information that I had, I warned the threat was getting worse way back on January the 27th and urged the need to put signs first, draw on emergency funds to get response started, think about invoking disaster powers to respond. Many of us talked about the need to get the U.S. scientists on the ground to see firsthand what was happening in China rather than relying on what came from China. My point is not simply that the president was wrong. My point is that the mindset, that was slow to recognize the problem in the first place to treat it with a seriousness is deserved, is still too much a part of how the president is addressing the problem. South Korea detected their first case of coronavirus on the same day we did, but they had tests and sophisticated tracing programs to stop the spread of the virus, so they didn\'t have to put the entire country on lockdown. We had none of that.","I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don\'t see much of a distinction beyond that.","I wasn\'t built to look the other way because the law demanded it. The law might be wrong.","Deep in the heart of every American, I think there burns a flame. It\'s an inheritance from every generation of Americans that has come before us. That\'s why we have overcome every crisis we have ever faced before. It\'s what makes this nation so special, why we stand apart. That flame is not going to be extinguished in this moment. If our leadership does its part, the American people will do more than their part.","The art of living is simply getting up after you\'ve been knocked down.","People were desperate to vent their anger, and if they could yell at a united States senator, all the better. Part of being a public servant, I came to understand in 1978, was absorbing the anger of people who don\'t know where to turn. If I couldn\'t solve the problem for them, I had to at least be an outlet.","Simply put, the radical fundamentalists seek to kill our citizens in great numbers, to disrupt our economy, and to reshape the international order. They would take the world backwards, replacing freedom with fear and hope with hatred.","America\'s experience -- and that of many other nations ... teaches that fostering entrepreneurship is not just about crafting the right economic policy or developing the best educational curriculum.  It\'s about creating a free political climate in which ideas and innovation can flourish. Simply put, governments that protect liberties, embrace transparency allow for vibrant civil societies, give women equal opportunity, they are the ones that pave the way for thriving cultures.","We still have such a long way to go but today, most Americans now get the challenge we\'re facing. They believe in science. The issue is important to them and they want their leaders to act on climate, particularly young people, as you said, inspired by the activism of Greta and so many young Americans as well, who are leading on climate.","So now, on this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol\'s very foundation, we come together as one nation under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic, and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.","The system wasn\'t working, and I thought it was time to err on the side of a new model. What might work, I thought, was a system that promoted personal accountability, consistency, and certainty. Congress could say people who committed the same federal crime, under the same circumstances, were going to jail for the same amount of time. We could give judges a narrower set of sentencing guidelines to work with, and felons would be required to pay the same price. We\'d be judging the crime, not the person.","We are a decent, brave, resilient people. We can believe again, but we are better than this moment. We are better than this President [Trump].","NATO is in fact going to crumble if we don\'t beat Trump. NATO is in real trouble. We need NATO for more reasons than just physical security. We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before. It wasn\'t just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States, coming into Europe. It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world, to unite Europe in our behalf.","It is precisely because all of us recognize what is at stake for our generation and those who follow that we will continue to speak out and insist that our Government act not only with determination but with effectiveness, not only with conviction but with wisdom.","After 9-11, the President had a historic opportunity to unite Americans and the world in common cause. Instead, by exploiting the politics of fear, instigating an optional war in Iraq before finishing a necessary war in Afghanistan and instituting policies on torture, detainees and domestic surveillance that fly in the face of our values and interests, President Bush divided Americans from each other and from the world.","Barack Obama has a vision of American greatness based not just on our unmatched military might, but on our economic, intellectual, and moral strengths. They were once the envy of the world. They can be again","Democratic revolutions like the ones in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya -- and the ones still unfolding in Syria and Yemen --are imbued, literally imbued with entrepreneurial spirit, a spirit that requires risk and initiative, steadfast determination, and a unifying idea.... The revolution that gave birth to my own country was inspired by the same desire for freedom and ensured that from its earliest days America has been hard-wired for innovation.  Back then, it was pamphleteers like Thomas Paine.  Today, it\'s modern new technologies that connect us in an instant.","Winning means uniting America not sewing more division and anger. It means not only fighting but healing the country.","The Corona virus is shining a bright light on the inequities in our country and there\'s so much work to do but I have no doubt we can meet these challenges brought on by this virus if we work together. The American people have never, not a joke, I know you\'re tired of hearing me say this, have never, ever, ever, ever let the country down given half a chance. They\'re tough, there\'s no quit in America. They\'re prepared but we\'ve got to do it together.","My message to everyone who\'s been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign. We need you. We want you and there\'s a place for you in our campaign.","Public servants are obliged to level with everybody, whether or not they\'ll like what he has to say.","Al Qaeda must be destroyed. Its ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction must be stopped. But to compare terrorism with an all encompassing ideology like Communism and Fascism is evidence of profound confusion. Terrorism is a means, not an end, and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals. President Bush and Senator McCain lump together, as a single threat, extremist groups and states as at odds with each other as they are with us: Sunnis and Shiites, Persian and Arabs, Iraq and Iran, Al Qaeda and Shiite militia. If they can\'t identify the enemy or describe the war we\'re fighting, it\'s difficult to see how we will win.","In the 21st century, nations cannot; and we cannot allow them to redraw borders by force. These are the ground rules. And if we fail to uphold them, we will rue the day. Russia has violated these ground rules and continues to violate them. Today Russia is occupying sovereign Ukrainian territory. Let me be crystal clear: The United States does not, will not, never will recognize Russia\'s attempt to annex the Crimea.","I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know that the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal, and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.","I often say beating Trump won\'t end climate change, but it\'s a critical first step. Last week, Trump reversed the rule requiring power plants to reduce the amount of mercury and other pollutions that are pumping into the air. Pollution that is bad for human health, to state the obvious, and it\'s wrong. It\'s a step backwards.","The answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don\'t look like you or worship the way you do or don\'t get their news from the same source as you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.","It\'s not just the automobile industry is coming back, folks. Manufacturing is coming back. The middle class is coming back. America is coming back -- worker by worker, home by home, community by community, this country is coming back.","No one should be forced to stay with their abuser because they don\'t have the resources to leave.","It required a lot less energy, intelligence, and competence to run against government than to try to make government work.","Some of my friends in the current administration have little interest in alliances, international organizations and treaties. There\'s a logic to their disengagement. They start from the premise that America\'s military might is the single most important determinant in the international system. Because that might is so much greater than anyone else\'s they see allies and agreements as more of a burden than a benefit. It\'s Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians.","My father had an expression he repeated a thousand times growing up: Every man and woman is entitled to be treated with dignity. Everyone. That\'s what your new revolution was about: dignity.","No matter what, I\'m still in this for the same reason, we have to restore the soul of this country, bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together.","For too long in this society, we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community. For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest. For a decade, led by Ronald Reagan, self-aggrandizement has been the full-throated cry of this society: \'I\'ve got mine, so why don\'t you get yours\' and \'What\'s in it for me?\'","Folks, talk is cheap. False promises are deceptive and talk and revolution isn\'t changing anyone\'s life.","The idea that we can wipe out every vestige of Iran\'s influence in Iraq is a fantasy. Even with 160,000 American troops in Iraq, Prime Minister Maliki, our ally in Baghdad greets Iran\'s leader with kisses. Like it or not, Iran is a major regional power and it shares a long border &#150; and a long history &#150; with Iraq.","The fact that our economy is three and a half times as large as the next largest economy and larger than the next four combined does not make us immune from what\'s happening around the world.","When seagull droppings landed on my head at a campaign event at Bowers Beach two days before Election Day, I chose to read it as a sign of a coming success.","We can and we must build a more perfect union. Because the American people have seen the alternative.","Ordinary people given an opportunity are capable of accomplishing extraordinary things.","A little thing we\'ve begun to do is replace all the traditional light bulbs in our house with fluorescent light bulbs. I introduced a bill to promote compact fluorescent light bulbs. If every family in America changed just one bulb, we could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 7 million tons per year. There are a lot of little things we can do to make a gigantic change.","Once we decided to focus on Iraq, we went to war too soon. We went without the rest of the world, and we went under false premises. This administration told us we would be greeted with open arms, that we had enough troops to stabilize the country, that Iraqi oil would pay for the reconstruction. They were wrong on each of these counts and many more. The result is a terrible irony. Iraq now risks becoming what it was not before the war: a haven for the very radical Islamic fundamentalists who would do us such harm.","Our military might and economic resources are necessary but not sufficient to lead us into this new century. It is our ideas and ideals that will allow us to exert the kind of leadership that persuades others to follow and to deal effectively with these forces of change.","Well, there are a number of lessons to this war. One of the lessons of the war is that when you go into a country that is under a dictatorship, no matter what the underlying makeup of the country is, that it takes an awful long time to be able to help re-establish a circumstance where there\'s a possibility of a democratic country emerging. And so that\'s one of the lessons I think everyone has learned.","I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions. There ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus as to do that.","Instead of regime change, we should focus on conduct change. We should make it very clear to Iran what it risks in terms of isolation if it continues to pursue a dangerous nuclear program but also what it stands to gain if it does the right thing. That will require keeping our allies in Europe, as well as Russia and China, on the same page as we ratchet up pressure. It also requires a more sophisticated understanding that by publicly engaging Iran &#150; including through direct talks &#150; we can exploit cracks within the ruling elite and between Iran&rsquo;s rulers and its people, who are struggling economically and stifled politically. The Iranian people need to know that their government, not the United States, is choosing confrontation over cooperation. Our allies and partners need to know that the United States will go the extra diplomatic mile &#150; if we do, they are much more likely to stand with us if diplomacy fails.","I\'m not used to these standing ovations, I\'m a Vice President. ","Look, no one should have to choose between earning a living and protecting their own health. As well the health of those around them they love so much. This virus has made all too clear the absolute necessity of making sure everyone, everyone, can access affordable, high quality healthcare. That\'s what our government should be doing right now. Not fighting in the courts to strip away the healthcare protections from folks who need it more than ever. Testing, rapid results, treatment, and ultimately access to a vaccine for COVID-19 should be available to everyone, and I mean everyone, free of cost.","And by the way, this time when we rebuild the middle class, we got to bring everybody along, everybody along, black, brown, women, men, straight, across the board. The idea that somehow people are just figuring this out kind of surprises me, but everybody\'s just looking for a shot. No one\'s looking for a handout. Everybody\'s looking for just an even shot and they don\'t feel like they\'re getting a chance because they\'re not. They\'re being left behind. But I promise you, I give you my word as a Biden, I\'m going to bring everybody along this time. Everybody along.","Politics doesn\'t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn\'t have to be a cause for total war.","I didn\'t argue that the war in Vietnam was immoral; it was merely stupid and a horrendous waste of time, money, and lives based on a flawed premise.","You can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind, but even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.","Donald Trump talks about America first. He\'s made America alone.","We\'re seeing during this crisis just why it is so important for American workers to belong to unions, so that they have someone to fight for them and with them.","Make no mistake about it. This campaign will send Donald Trump packing. This campaign is taking off. Join us.","Together we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness. A story of decency and dignity, love and healing, greatness and goodness.","I hope today and in the days ahead, the president will give us the unvarnished truth. That\'s what the American people need and what they deserve. I hope he lets the medical experts and FEMA leaders and others carrying out the work to take center stage, to hear from them directly. And I hope we hear less talk and see more evidence of fast action.","There is never a time when a president can act to stop a tragedy from occurring without being held politically accountable one way or the other. If he does it and fails, he\'s wrong. If he does it and succeeds, he was never right because it didn\'t happen. If we go in and stop an act of genocide, we can\'t prove what we stopped.","I still have my 1967 Goodwood-green Corvette, 327, 350-horse, with a rear-axle ratio that really gets up and goes. The Secret Service won\'t let me drive it. I\'m not allowed to drive anything. It\'s the one thing I hate about this job. I\'m serious.","My dad used to say, \\"Without your word, you\'re not a man.\\"","Wall Street and the CEO\'s didn\'t build this country. The middle class did. And the middle class was built by unions. Unions built the middle-class. And working families and unions will be the drivers of our success once again, when we get through this. Together, we\'ll make sure that everyone has a chance to build a solid middle-class life for themselves and for their families in the 21st century economy.","Full disclosure: I do not have absolute faith in the judgment and wisdom of the American people. We\'re all human, and we can all be misled. When leaders don\'t level with citizens, we can\'t expect them to make good judgments. But I do have absolute faith in the <em>heart</em> of the American people. The greatest resource in this country is the grit, the resolve, the courage, the basic decency, and the stubborn pride of its citizens.","All across the nation, it\'s so often our lowest-paid workers who have to step up during this crisis and crises like this. You\'re putting yourselves on the line every single day. You\'re sacrificing so much under dire circumstances to do your job and you\'re doing it for not just yourself, for all of us. You\'re essential to our society in times of crisis and beyond. You deserve not just our thanks and our respect, you deserve a safe workplace and fair pay. You deserve personal protective equipment including gloves and masks that enables you to do your job as safely as possible.","The most powerful military in the world cannot invade, kill or capture a network or destroy every loose weapon on the planet. The best response to this network of terror is to build a network of our own -- a network of like-minded countries and organizations that pools resources, information, ideas, and power. Taking on the radical fundamentalists alone isn\'t necessary, it isn\'t smart, and it won\'t succeed. ","The oil companies don\'t need an incentive of $4 billion to go out and explore. As my grandpop would say, \'They\'re doing just fine, thank you\'.","I don\'t accept this proposition that somehow the U.S. cannot handle a heavy-duty manufacturing capacity, that we should shift our focus to service industries. Look at Japan and Germany--their labor costs are as high as ours. Big countries have to be able to make big things. Have to.","Just because our political heroes were murdered does not mean that the dream does not still live, buried deep in our broken hearts.","Saddam Hussein\'s pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, in my view, is one of those clear dangers. Even if the right response to his pursuit is not so crystal clear, one thing is clear. These weapons must be dislodged from Saddam Hussein, or Saddam Hussein must be dislodged from power.","The terrorists who attacked the Pentagon ... sought to weaken America by shattering this defining symbol of our military might and prowess. But they failed. And they also failed for another reason, not just physically failed. They failed because they continue to fundamentally misunderstand us, as they misunderstood us on that day. For the true source of American power does not lie within that building because as Americans, we draw our strength from the rich tapestry of our people.","It is an exciting and dangerous time, for this generation of Americans has the opportunity so rarely granted to others by fate and history. We literally have the chance to shape the future -- to put our own stamp on the face and character of America, to bend history just a little bit.","I made a mistake. I underestimated the influence of Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and the rest of the neocons; I vastly underestimated their disingenuousness and incompetence. So George W. Bush went to war again, and just the way the neocons wanted him to--without significant international backing.","Our failure in recent years has not been the failure of the people to meet the challenges placed before them, but rather the failure of both our great political parties to place those challenges honestly and courageously before the people, and to trust the willingness of the people to do the things that really need to be done.","Our current policy in Iraq is a failure. We are past the point of an open-ended commitment. We are past the point of adding more troops. We are past the point of vague policy prescriptions. It is not an answer just to stay. Nor is it an answer -- though it may become a necessity -- just to go, with no concern for what follows. The fundamental question we must answer is whether, as we begin to leave Iraq, there are still concrete steps we can take to avoid leaving chaos behind.","Every morning I start off like I did this morning, with leading medical advisors for an hour, an hour and a half briefing on the state of the Corona virus in the United States. And guess what? Nursing homes and meat packing plants, are the most dangerous places there are right now. That\'s not up for debate. Thousands of infections have been traced back to meat packing plants and at least 30 workers have died from it. They designate them as essential workers, then treat them as disposable. It\'s quite frankly inhumane and downright immoral because these workers are essential to our society. Not just in times of crisis, but always.","america is a nation that can be defined in one word: awmdwdafotaimamimafiootaima.","Help."]');
